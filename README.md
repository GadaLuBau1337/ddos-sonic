# Cursed Objects
This script got it's name from **GadaLuBau**, yet I do not know why I did so. 

### Proofs
``Single machine 1 GBPS and public proxies``

### Disclaimer

# Usage
``<bin> -help``

Keep in mind to paste all your proxies into the file called `proxies.txt`. Make sure all the proxies are valid and working ones, as this script is not checking for any proxy validity. Be sure to include **HTTP/HTTPS proxies only**.

# Build
Get your self some `Go` and afterwards you can compile and get a binary using `go build`
